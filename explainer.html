      <h2> 1. Motivation </h2>
        <h3> What is your dataset? </h3>
          <p> Our dataset consists of details on Uber and Yellow taxi rides from April 2014 to December 2017. It contains information such as :
             pickup and dropoff location, date and time of pickup/dropoff as well as some details about the journey,
              the price, the tip given, etc but only for the yellow taxi dataset. </p>
        <h3> Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)? </h3>
                <p> With assignment 2, we learned about New York City on a crimes level.
                   We wanted to learn more about the city’s “soft side” as well. But more seriously, the rise of peer-to-peer
                   technology is an important aspect of society, and comparing the use of this new technology with a traditional
                   transportation sector is interesting. Moreover, the Uber trend goes hand-in-hand with where the world is moving forward to : automatization,
                    self-driving cars, etc. So this is a trend worth taking a look into. </p>
        <h3> What was your goal for the end user’s experience? </h3>
          <p> Our goal is to familiarize the end user with the cab setting in NYC : understanding the Uber trend, seeing where people go with cabs, compare the number and the location of Uber rides versus yellow taxi rides.
            Our project might help getting answer as to whether traditional cabs will be entirely replaced by Uber one day. </p>

            <h2> 2. Basic Stats </h2>
              <h3> Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing </h3>
                <p>We had two datasets at our disposal : one with the yellow taxi data which was very thorough (19 columns including pickup and dropoff location, date & time, distance of the trip, details on payment, …) and one with the Uber data which was relatively poor in terms of variables (only 4 columns including pickup location and date & time). That’s why we had to “sacrifice” most of the yellow cab data for our comparative analysis : we filtered the data to keep only the information that was present for both Uber and yellow cabs meaning date, time and pickup location. In order to do this we used excel and pandas for the Uber dataset since it was smaller, and pandas for the yellow cab data.   </p>
              <h3> Write a short section that discusses the dataset stats, containing key points/plots from your exploratory data analysis. </h3>
                      <p> The raw Uber dataset is about 15 GB and the Yellow Taxi one is approximately 50 GB before filtering and preprocessing. During the year 2014 alone there were about 160 million yellow taxi rides in New York City so it’s obvious that we had to make some cuts from the dataset or else the webpage would’ve crashed. For instance, we had to filter the data by month, by day and by hour and then aggregate it to have a lighter csv file to use for our visualizations. </p>

          <h2>3. Genre</h2>
                    <h3> Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrative (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?</h3>
                    <p> For the visual structuring, we used a linear progression from top to bottom because it’s the most intuitive for the end user. Moreover we have a consistent visual platform
                        since each of our sections contain one visualization and some text description and analysis. </p>
                      <p>  As for the highlighting, we use a consistent but vivid color palette and center our visualization in each section so it will be the first thing the reader sees.</p>
                      <p>  Finally for the transition guidance, we used animated transitions when toggling between different filters on our visualizations. </p>

                  <h3>Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why? </h3>
                    <p> Regarding ordering, we put titles for each section with different font sizes to help the viewer know when they start a new section. Moreover our data story is quite linear and so is the ordering on the webpage.</p>
                    <p>  For interactivity, we use a hover feature on our bar charts and chord chart as well as filtering on all our visualizations. The hover feature lets the user get more information from the visualizations whereas the filtering is essential for our analysis.</p>
                    <p>  Finally, for messaging, all our visualizations have labels as well as an explanatory paragraph coupled with an analysis paragraph to best understand it. We use this to stick to our annotated chart genre.</p>

        <h2>4. Visualizations </h2>

              <p>Our main objective is to show the cab landscape in New York City in terms of yellow taxis and Ubers.
<p>The first visualization we show is a set of two interactive bar charts depicting the number of Uber and Yellow taxi rides per day and per hour in order to see some trend. We arbitrarily chose the month of May and the first day of this month for this visualization. These bar charts let the viewer compare the use of Uber with yellow taxis every day and during every hour of the day. It will enable him to draw some conclusions as to the popularity of each means of transportation given the hour in the day. </p>
<p>After this, we show the more general evolution of the number of rides across the years in a line chart where we see the total number of rides for each time stamp for both Uber and yellow cabs. This lets the user see the moment when Uber surpassed yellow taxis in terms of popularity in New York City. </p>
<p>Finally, our last visualization is a brushable timeline linked to a map that show the geographic usage of yellow cabs and Uber. This shows the reader where people tend to use Ubers and taxis and can help him to understand some of the habits of new yorkers.</p>

<h2>5. Discussion</h2>
<h3> What went well? </h3>
<p> The data is by essence very “visual” so the visualization created are very easy to read and to understand. It also helps users to draw their own conclusions in addition to the analysis we provided. It was a good project for us because we discovered another aspect of New York City and we understood a bit more about the routine and habits of new yorkers thanks to this study. Furthermore, we believe we answered our initial questions about the Uber trend and the general use of cabs in NYC.</p>
<h3> What is still missing ? What could be improved?</h3>
<p> At first we had many other ideas for this project that we had to drop either because of lack of data or lack of time and expertise. For instance, one of our initial goals was to use machine learning to “prescribe” people a type of ride (Uber or yellow taxi) according to the date and time they were looking for. However, we were missing crucial data for this model such as the price of Uber rides as well as the wait time for both Uber and taxis. Another thing we wanted to do was a chord chart depicting the areas where people go and come from inside Manhattan when they use a yellow taxi or an Uber. However this appeared to be too complicated given the time at our disposal.</p>
<p>Regarding improvement, we could have considered larger time periods for our visualization but we didn’t because of the size of the dataset. What we could have done is group many points (corresponding to different dates) into one and then display only this point on the map for example. Moreover, on the map there are some points to the left that are not contained in any boroughs. If we had more time, we could’ve taken a more precise look at the geojson file and fix this problem.
